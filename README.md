The way this WordPress Plugin works is that once your webpage has been opened, the Zendesk Chat Widget will have a slight time delay in loading, giving more time and room for the whole webpage to load first, thus decreasing its loading time. After a few seconds, the Zendesk Chat Widget will now load and open by itself.

This process follows two criteria:

- Webpage is loaded but left still - The Zendesk Chat Widget will wait for 10 seconds before loading and opening.
- Webpage is loaded and scrolled upon - The Zendesk Chat Widget will wait for 3 seconds before loading and opening.


This plugin also provides a Zendesk Chat Settings Page located on your WordPress Dashboard > Settings, where you can enter your Zendesk Chat API Code.
