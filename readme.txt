* Webpage is loaded and scrolled upon - The Zendesk Chat Widget will wait for 3 seconds before loading and opening.
* The Settings of the Plugin allow you to increase the 10 second delay further if needed



This plugin also provides a Zendesk Chat Settings Page located on your WordPress Dashboard > Settings. Simply follow the instructions to enter your Zendesk Chat API Key and you are done. Quick and easay to implement.
