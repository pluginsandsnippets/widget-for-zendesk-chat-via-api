Improve the loading speed of your website by allowing a slight time delay on your Zendesk Chat Widget.


== Description ==

**This plugin loads Zendesk Chat widget (formerly Zopim chat) via API with a slight time delay. This improves the page loading speed of your website compared to the standard Zendesk Chat plugin. Make your website faster loading Zendesk Chat widget this way!**
 
The way this WordPress Plugin works is that once your webpage has been opened, the Zendesk Chat Widget will have a slight time delay in loading, giving more time and room for the whole webpage to load first, thus decreasing its loading time. After a few seconds, the Zendesk Chat Widget will now load and open by itself.

This process follows two criteria:

* Webpage is loaded but left still - The Zendesk Chat Widget will wait for 10 seconds before loading and opening.
* Webpage is loaded and scrolled upon - The Zendesk Chat Widget will wait for 3 seconds before loading and opening.

This plugin also provides a Zendesk Chat Settings Page located on your WordPress Dashboard > Settings, where you can enter your Zendesk Chat API Code.
